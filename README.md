## Introduction

This plugin allows to publish Helm charts using Semantic Release. For now the only backend available is GitHub Pages. PRs welcome for support for more backends  like [Chart Museum](https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum).

## Pre-Requisites

Before starting creating releases, you must create a new branch in your Chart repository and enable github pages for that branch.

You also need to initialize a Helm Repo by commiting an index.yaml to the that branch.

You can generate an empty index.yaml, by running the following command in your chart repo:

```sh
helm repo index . --url <github_pages_url>
```

### Usage

You can see an example repo, demonstrating this plugin in action [here](https://github.com/brpaz/semantic-release-helm-demo).

For integration with your chart, create a `.releaserc` file in the root of your repository with the plugin defined:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    [
        "@brpaz/semantic-release-helm",
        {
          "chartPath": ".",
          "chartRepository": {
            "branch": "gh-pages",
            "url": "<gh_pages_url>",
            "repository": "brpaz/chartRepo"
          }
        }
      ]
  ]
  ```

The following plugin options are supported:

* **chartPath**: Required - Indicates the path to your the root of your Chart. (It should point to the directory containing the Chart.yaml file)
* **chartRepository.branch**:  Indicates the branch where the repository will be published. Defaults to **gh-pages**
* **chartRepository.repository**: The repository name where the chart will be published in the format: "<username><repo>".
* **chartRepository.url**:  The public url of the GitHub Pages. This is used to fetch the current chart index.

For more information, please see Semantic Release [documentation](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/extending/plugins-list)

For an example to use with GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Semantic Release
        uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2
        with:
          extra_plugins: |
            @brpaz/semantic-release-helm
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
